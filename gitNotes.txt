First step after creating a file:

Steps 1 and 2 are to initialize
1: git init (Will initialize git repository)
2: git remote add origin <ssh key goes here>

Steps 3 -  are to push things to github

3: git add . (The dot means to add everything in the current directory)
4: git commit -m "<message goes here>"
IMPORTANT: git push -u origin main
THIS HAS TO COME FIRST OR IT WON'T WORK
5: git status (This can be done at any point, this is just getting the status of where things are at.)
6: git branch (You can do this whenever you want, This lets you know what branch you're operating on, it makes sure you push to the correct branch)
7: git push origin <branch>  (This actually pushes everything up to github.
