These are my notes.

Github:

There are 3 steps to adding code to github. git add, git commit, and git push.
For this analogy, I'll be comparing the github repository to a blog, and the code thats pushed to it to text.

Git Add: 

This command adds whatever code you select into the git history. The way I understand it,
this is analagous to adding text to a word document.

Git commit:

This command actually takes a snapshot of the stuff that you've added, and lets you add a message
saying what you actually added. This is analagous to saving the file that you've just edited.

Git push:

This command actually pushes what you've just saved to your github repository.
This could be analagous to actually posting what you've just typed and saved in that document
to your own personal blog.
